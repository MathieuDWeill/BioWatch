# BioWatch
BioWatch - the powerful app that makes it easy to monitor and manage invasive species in your community. 

With BioWatch, you can easily collect and record evidence of invasive species in your community, such as photos, GPS locations, and detailed notes.
You can track and manage the species you've identified using the "Reports" table, which allows you to filter and sort by species type, location, and other key parameters.

AppSheet: BioWatch was developed using the AppSheet platform, which is built on Google Cloud Platform. This allowed us to quickly and easily create a mobile app that can be accessed by users on both Android and iOS devices.

Google Maps API: BioWatch uses Google Maps to provide users with accurate location data, allowing them to track and manage invasive species sightings with precision.

Google Drive: BioWatch integrates with Google Drive, making it easy for users to share evidence and reports with others in their community.

Google Sheets: BioWatch users can export their app data to Google Sheets, allowing for easy analysis and reporting.

By leveraging these Google products and platforms, BioWatch provides users with a powerful and easy-to-use tool for monitoring and managing invasive species in their community. The integration with Google Maps, Google Drive, and Google Sheets allows for seamless collaboration and reporting, making it easier for communities to work together to combat this important environmental challenge.
